# CONTRIBUTING TO BIKE_RENTAL_PROJECT
I would love your input! I want to make contributing to this process as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

## All changes will happen through pull-requests:
* Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
* If you have added code that should be tested, add tests.
* Change the documentation accordingly, if a change is done.
* Issue that pull-request.

## Use a consistent coding-style
* Make sure your code lints
